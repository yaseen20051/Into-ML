# Into-ML  
**My personal Machine Learning playground – every model I build lives here**

Welcome to my growing collection of machine learning projects, experiments, and from-scratch implementations!  
This repo is my public lab notebook: whenever I finish a model (especially the ones I’m proud of), I drop it here with clean code, detailed explanations, and pretty visualizations.

### Current Highlights

#### Breast Cancer Classification – Decision Tree & Random Forest From Scratch (Dec 2025)  
100 % hand-coded (no sklearn classifiers) on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset  
- Untuned monster tree → pruned tree (90.1 %) → full Random Forest (94.7 %)  
- Bootstrap sampling, random feature subsets, OOB error, voting – all built from the ground up  
- Complete journey in notebooks + insane tree visualizations  
→ `Breast_Cancer_From_Scratch/` folder

(Expect many more folders like this to appear over time)

### Why this repo exists
- To keep all my ML work in one clean, organized place  
- To show my progress from “copy-paste tutorials” to “I can build Random Forest with only NumPy”  
- To get feedback, stars, and roasts on my code  
- To help anyone else who’s learning the same stuff (you’re welcome to steal, fork, or laugh at my code)

### What you’ll typically find in each project folder
- Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanation  
- Clean Python scripts (.py)  
- Detailed README inside the folder  
- Visualizations, confusion matrices, feature importance plots  
- requirements.txt or environment details  

### Future models coming soon (watch this space)
- Neural networks from scratch  
- CNNs on medical images  
- XGBoost / LightGBM deep dives  
- NLP projects, clustering, anomaly detection… whatever I get obsessed with next

Feel free to:
- Star if you like what you see
- Open issues (“your variable names hurt me” is valid feedback)
- Fork and improve anything
- Say hi or suggest datasets/models!
